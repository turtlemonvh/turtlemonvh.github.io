      Posted on Tue 27 February 2018 in <a href="https://turtlemonvh.github.io/category/articles.html">Articles</a>

    </p>
  </header>


  <div>
    <p>When I started working with Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">API Gateway service</a> earlier today, this is not the title I expected the article would have.</p>
<p>If you read through documentation and blog articles by Amazon, it sounds like API Gateway is an awesome solution for serverless integrations with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-s3.html">S3</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-amazon-api-gateway-as-a-proxy-for-dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-kinesis.html">Kinesis</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/@gayanhewa/api-gateway-and-service-proxy-with-sqs-2699c6960690">SQS</a>.</p>
<p>However, when I started work on some simple integrations I quickly hit significant roadblocks.</p>
<h2>What was I trying to build</h2>
<p>I was working on an example integration of API Gateway with S3.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a REST API where users would be able to read and write from paths in a bucket with a prefix based on their username.  In the demo, I was pulling the user's username from a request parameter, but I was planning on changing that over to use an authenticated Google username via <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/google.html">AWS Cognito federated identities</a>.</p>
<p>There was a bit more to the plan than that, but that's all I was starting with. Read and write at a path relative to a prefix. Return either a JSON list of objects or an object itself.  Nothing fancy, so I assumed this would be a very simple integration.</p>
<h2>Problem 1: Lack of support for XML parsing</h2>
<p>Many of the AWS endpoints return XML responses.  API Gateway deals almost excusively with JSON, and provides no facilities for working with XML except for passing XML response through unmodified.</p>
<p>Handling XML may be on the product team's roadmap, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40325005/how-do-i-convert-xml-to-json-aws-api-gateway">it doesn't seem to be a high priority issue</a>.  Without XML support, integrating with S3 to produce an API that can list objects in a bucket and return a JSON representation of that list is not possible without resorting to a lambda function to glue things together.</p>
<h2>Problem 2: Inability to template anything except for the request body</h2>
<p>Many APIs require passing parameters outside the request body to get things done.  For example, the AWS S3 REST API <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/v2-RESTBucketGET.html">only accepts query parameters</a> uses only query parameters to list items.</p>
<p>However, API Gateway does not provice any way to set headers or query parameters in a request except for </p>
<ul>
<li>copying fields 1:1 from headers, query parameters, or path components in the request body</li>
<li>setting a constant string</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no form of templating supported, so even simple changes to a query parameter (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49016313/how-to-append-a-prefix-to-a-querystring-parameter-in-aws-api-gateway">like adding a prefix</a>) are not supported.</p>
<h2>Problem 3: Painful changes to API design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I can give AWS a bit of a break here since they seem to be <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html">pushing users toward Swagger definitions for APIs</a>, and using Swagger and batch importing an API definition as it changes may have helped avoid some of these issues.  However, I find that often when just exploring a new technology the UI often helps me discover the best patterns for using a tool, so I wanted to give the web console for as many actions as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to rename an api resource from <code>{folder}</code> to <code>{item}</code>. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-settings-method-request.html#setup-method-resources">The <code>{</code>s are needed to capture parameters from the url path</a>.  There was nothing on the web console that allowed me to rename a resource (a pretty common operation when working on an API design!).</p>
<p>After a bit of Googling around, I found <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=215649">other people complaining about the same thing</a>, then a reference to <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=731761&#731761;">a fix using the cli</a>.  Awesome!  I mean, maybe a rename button would be nice but I'm fine with a CLI.</p>
<p>However, when I went to run the command to make the change, I ran into issues.  First, running the command requires passing a series of patches with the fields <code>op</code>, <code>path</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>from</code>.  The documentation for what these mean is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/update-resource.html">sparse</a>.  Thankfully one of the examples was demonstrating exactly what I wanted to do, so I was able to use that as a starting point.  Secondly, I ran into an issue getting the command to run.  I'll let my command history speak for itself.</p>

<p>The fact that such a simple change requires so many steps is a strong indicator of a lack of maturity in API Gateway.</p>
<h2>Problem 5: Testing</h2>
<p>Testing was both kind of awesome and not quite as awesome as I hoped.</p>
<p>When you click down to any method on a resource, there is an option to test.  When you click on "test", you are taken to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-test-method.html">a page where you can fill in request parameters and run a test request</a>.  This was invaluable for testing my GET methods and working through authorization issues.</p>
<p>However, there were 2 limitations I hit quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-payload-encodings-configure-with-console.html">you can send binary data to API Gateway</a>, you cannot send binary data in a test request in the console.  You have to send a body that you can paste into a text box.  Considering how common it is to add an option to upload a file to test something, this seems like a pretty strange oversight.</li>
<li>Request headers are trimmed.  I mean, the WHOLE PURPOSE is debugging.  Throwing away a large chunk of important request data is a strange design choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I was frustrated by how difficult it was to build out an API with API Gateway.  I came into this with high expectations, thinking that my simple example was something I would be able to throw together in a couple hours.  In reality I spent most of a day working on something which still doesn't work yet.</p>
<p>I will probably still try to use API Gateway going forward.  The integration with DynamoDB looks to be a little stronger, and I think that putting authentication into API Gateway will make some of the solutions I am working on easier to assemble.  Now, however, I think my expectations are a bit lower.  I expect that I will need to move most non-trivial logic into lambda functions, and just lean on API Gateway for a small part of its feature set.</p>
<p>As I continue working with API Gateway, I'll come back here to add additional posts about any useful patterns or techniques I learn, features that solve some of these problems or other problems, or just interesting use cases.</p>
