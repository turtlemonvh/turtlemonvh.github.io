    <p>Yesterday I went to <a href="http://www.lowes.com/">Lowes</a> with my wife to get pieces for a <a href="http://www.rubbermaid.com/en-US/shop-products/closet---shelving">modular shelving unit</a> we were installing in our laundry room.  Instead of going with a pre-packaged shelving arrangement, we had decided to custom cut the shelving for a better fit.  The store had several length options available for the main shelves: 12 foot, 6 foot, 4 foot, 3 foot.  I knew the length of each of the 6 pieces I needed, down to the quarter of an inch.  The store provided the service of cutting the stock shelve pieces to length for free.</p>
<p>At this point any readers who spent time in a linear optimization or operations research course may be starting to sweat a little bit.  If you're not sure why, it's because what I just mentioned is a version of something usually referred to as "the cutting stock problem", and this can be expressed as <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~kksivara/ma505/handouts/gilmore-gomory2.pdf">a well formed mathematical problem</a> with a definite optimal solution.  Since you took the class, you <strong>should</strong> know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">how to solve it</a>, and if you don't, then well I guess math's not your thing after all right?</p>
<p><img alt="No math" src="https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/66238928.jpg"></p>
<p>Hmmm.  Or at least that was the feeling that I had while I was standing in the aisle yesterday trying to figure this thing out.  Unfortunately, from my class in linear optimization I also remembered that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Actually expressing a real world problem as a system of linear equations can be pretty tough</li>
<li>After that, you usually wanted a computer for solving anything with more than ~3 simultaneous equations</li>
<li>You'd still need to program the computer for the algorithm, or find a package to do it for you</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I realized the math side of my brain was failing me and I had to figure out a different approach to the problem.  That or my wife came by and asked why it was taking so long.  It's hard to keep track of those kinds of details.  So I just picked "the dumb solution" (use a couple of 12 foot long shelves) and asked to have someone paged over to cut the shelves for us.</p>
<p>Having now been shaken out of my mathematical stupor, I realized a few other details that I had missed in my singular pursuit of a mathematically elegant solution to my problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several of the long shelve stock pieces were bent. So we were probably going to get them for a discount.  (We ended up getting them for half price.)</li>
<li>For the pieces that were bent, I had to rearrange the cuts to work around the bent pieces of the shelve, so having a little waste (i.e. slack) was necessary.</li>
<li>The shelve stock pieces were $20 each for 12 foot sections, but the mounting hardware packs were $12 and corner pieces were $18. So the price of straight shelve pieces was going to be only a small part of the total price. (It ended up being $20 of a $180 total.)</li>
<li>The waste pieces weren't really waste, since I could use them as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YDe08UQop0">makeshift trellis</a> in our garden.</li>
</ol>
<p>So really my focus on the math had caused me to ignore a lot of pretty obvious factors that were much more important than setting up the exact arrangement of cuts to mimimize waste.</p>
<p>There are parallels good practices in software here.  Something about <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch12s02.html">measuring before optimizing</a>.  There are parallels to good engineering here.  Something about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption-based_planning">being explicit about your assumptions</a>.  The funny thing is that these relatively easy to remember heuristics will often get you closer to a globally optimal and robust solution than focusing on the parts of the system that are well behaved and expressible in clear mathematical terms.</p>
<p>Hopefully this can be as good of a reminder for some of you as it was for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S. - 
I had to go back and use my hacksaw to trim some of those cut pieces anyway. It turns out my measurements were good but the shelves were designed to have 1/4-1/2 inch of space between them.  That and the corners of the laundry room were not perfectly square.</p>
