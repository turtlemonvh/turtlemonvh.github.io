Title: Java CLI tools with GraalVM: An experience report
Date: 2020-05-07 23:00
Tags: jvm, cli, graalvm
Status: published

Over the last few years I have used several CLI tools written in java.  Usually these have been utility tools packaged with JVM applications, like kafka. The slow startup time from the JVM (and general bloatiness) of these tools has made me wholly uninterested in the JVM as a tool for CLI applications.

But a few years ago I heard about [the graalvm project](https://www.graalvm.org/) and its efforts to produce native images from JVM bytecode. Since then, I've been looking for an excuse to play around with the project.  This week I finally found one when we were discussing packaging for a java-based CLI tool developed at Ionic: [the cloud copy tool](https://github.com/IonicDev/ionic-cloud-copy-tool).

To get started, first I downloaded the tarballs for java8 and java11 from [the graalvm github releases page](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-20.0.0).


```bash
# I took a more manual approach, but this may be a simpler approach to install if you are less concerned with homebrew mucking with your Java settings
# https://github.com/graalvm/homebrew-tap
# https://github.com/graalvm/homebrew-tap/blob/master/Casks/graalvm-ce-java8.rb

# Installation
cd /tmp/
tar xzvf ~/Downloads/graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf ~/Downloads/graalvm-ce-java8-20.0.0.tar.gz
sudo mv graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
sudo mv graalvm-ce-java8-20.0.0 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/

# Run this to make sure the installation worked
# See: https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/macos
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

# NOTE: Binaries associated with the release can be found in
# /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java8-20.0.0/Contents/Home/bin/
# /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java8-20.0.0/Contents/Home/jre/bin/

# Install the native-image tool
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java8-20.0.0/Contents/Home/bin/gu install native-image
```

Next I had to set up tools to build this java project (see: https://github.com/IonicDev/ionic-cloud-copy-tool), which is just Java 7+ and Maven 3+. I didn't have to install any Java versions (aside from the GraalVM versions above) since I already had those set up, but I didn't have maven set up.

```bash
# Install maven

# I was going to use brew (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/maven), but it seemed to just hang
# while trying to download jdk 13 (which was marked as a prerequisite for maven).
# Downloaded from here instead: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

# After downloading
cd /tmp/
tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz
rm apache-maven-3.6.3/bin/*.cmd
mv apache-maven-3.6.3 /usr/local/share/

# Add this to ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin

# Then update env
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now we can build and make sure the jar seems to behave.

```bash
# Build
$ mvn package
# Seems to work
$ java -jar target/IonicCloudCopyTool-* -h
<source> <destination> [-a 'attribute1:val1:val2,attribute2:val3']
  Data from the source is copied to the destination and protected with IDTCS if the destination is remote.
Sources:
  file/system/path
  string:'Text of choice.'
  s3://s3bucket/path/to/object
  gs://gcsbucket/path/to/object
  az:azureContainer/path/to/blob
Destinations:
  file/system/path
  stdout:
  s3://s3bucket/path/to/object
  gs://gcsbucket/path/to/object
  az:azureContainer/path/to/blob
-a only valid for local or string sources
Single Argument Commands:
  version
  config
```

That worked just fine. Next, we'll take a na√Øve attempt with native-image, based off this documentation: https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#native-images

So that didn't work.  So I tried again, with more flags (being lazy here).

```

So that was helpful, and gave me something to search for. Checking some Github issues, I see some comments about Java 11 behaving better than Java 8. I also saw some recommendations for common flags to add for debugging / fixing missing dependencies. I started by switching over to the java 11 version of `native-image`.

```bash
$ /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0/Contents/Home/bin/gu install native-image
Downloading: Component catalog from www.graalvm.org
Processing Component: Native Image
Downloading: Component native-image: Native Image  from github.com
Installing new component: Native Image (org.graalvm.native-image, version 20.0.0)
```

Then added some of those flags and tried again.

```bash
is-mbp-timothy4:ionic-cloud-copy-tool timothy$ /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0/Contents/Home/bin/native-image -ea -jar target/IonicCloudCopyTool-0.4.0.jar --no-fallback --enable-http --enable-https --allow-incomplete-classpath

Look at that, a native image! Comparing sizes, the native image process did result in a larger file.

```bash
# Native image
-rwxr-xr-x   1 timothy  1145057864    41M May  7 23:49 IonicCloudCopyTool-0.4.0
# Uberjar
-rw-r--r--   1 timothy  1145057864    21M May  7 23:29 IonicCloudCopyTool-0.4.0.jar
```

But we do get those *much* snappier response times we're looking for from a CLI application!

```bash
is-mbp-timothy4:ionic-cloud-copy-tool timothy$ time for i in $(seq 1 10); do java -jar target/IonicCloudCopyTool-*.jar -h >/dev/null; done

real	0m4.167s
user	0m3.321s
sys	0m1.474s

is-mbp-timothy4:ionic-cloud-copy-tool timothy$ time for i in $(seq 1 10); do target/IonicCloudCopyTool-0.4.0 -h >/dev/null; done

real	0m0.172s
user	0m0.036s
sys	0m0.065s
```

For a last step, let's move that binary onto our path and make sure it still looks ok.

```bash
$ cp target/IonicCloudCopyTool-0.4.0 /usr/local/bin/icct
$ which icct
/usr/local/bin/icct
$ icct -h
<source> <destination> [-a 'attribute1:val1:val2,attribute2:val3']
  Data from the source is copied to the destination and protected with IDTCS if the destination is remote.
Sources:
  file/system/path
  string:'Text of choice.'
  s3://s3bucket/path/to/object
  gs://gcsbucket/path/to/object
  az:azureContainer/path/to/blob
Destinations:
  file/system/path
  stdout:
  s3://s3bucket/path/to/object
  gs://gcsbucket/path/to/object
  az:azureContainer/path/to/blob
-a only valid for local or string sources
Single Argument Commands:
  version
  config
```

Note that I haven't used this binary for anything serious yet, so caveats abound, but if this works out I'll at least consider jvm + native image for CLI tools. Honestly I probably won't consider it too often because I love python and go and go cross compiling is awesome, but if there are JVM packages to do something interesting I'll be less prone to shy away from CLI-based tooling.

## EDIT: 20200508

Right after I published this post I ran some quick function tests on the binary produced by `native-image`.

```bash
# Version command is ok

```

So it looks like I have a bit more to dig into, likely involving [adding classpaths to the `native-image` call](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/671#issuecomment-422993966) and fixing [relection and dynamic resource loading](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CONFIGURE.md). It looks like `--allow-incomplete-classpath` was added to handle runtime dependencies that are not loaded, whereas I used it to force `native-image` to give me something when it was (rightly, it seems) complaining about missing dependencies at build time.

I'll publish updates on this post. If the work turns out to be significant, I'll move those updates to a new post.

## EDIT: 20200509

Continuing with graalvm, I'm following the recommendations in [the graalvm documentation for working with their java agent](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CONFIGURE.md) to trace the reflective calls (and resource access) from the application and write that to config files for the native image tool to consume.

```bash
# I'll be putting these directly into the META-INF directory of this maven project
# https://github.com/IonicDev/ionic-cloud-copy-tool
GRAAL_CONF_DIR=./src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image

So it looks like the error is getting swallowed into an unknown exception and returned as an error. I'll dig into this one later and post another update.

Since this is supposed to be an experience report, here are my thoughts at this point:

* The native image files are *much* faster to startup than the java jars (>10x), which is pretty awesome.
    * I'll keep messing with graal for that reason alone.
* The graal java agent (for writing `native-image` config files) is pretty cool, but definitely not a panacea.
* For larger projects I think these `native-image` config files would get hard to manage.
    * I would also be pretty uncomfortable deploying something that would hit a runtime exception in case a missing configuration just because I failed to exersize some edge case of the application's behavior to get the agent to write config for me.
    * I imagine this set of resources would stabilize over time, but as dependencies are updated this gives me yet another edge case of things to check.
    * This pushes us from the benefits of build time checks backwards to more run time worries. I'm used to dealing with this in python, but I trust large scala, go, and java systems more than python systems because of the safety static compilation and type checking.
* The swallowing of the native image related runtime exception is unfortunate.
    * Perhaps there is another way that the runtime can be instrumented to dump more details on error?
* The native image compile time is very slow.
    * Like 90s+ for a maven project that takes ~5s.
    * This makes iteration on this phase of development quite slow, and I imagine it gets worse for substantially larger projects.
    * I bet running the build in server mode can help with caching of build stages to make this less painful, but still, this is very slow.

In summary: this is really neat technology, but it does have some leaky abstractions associated with it. I can't just toss an uberjar over the wall at `native-image` and expect success. If the technology and solution continues to advance to resolve the complexities associated with reflection and build time I can see this becoming a tool useful for more general problems, but as it stands, I would be most likely to recommend Graal's `native-image` if I know someone really needed fast boot for an existing Java code base, or needed to wrap mature Java libraries for a CLI application. For many other scenarios (like greenfield development) I'd still be more likely to recommend a non-JVM language for these problems, most likely Go or Rust (I haven't played with Rust yet but I hear great things from people I respect).
