    * comparison of "duct tape programmers" and "architecture astronauts"
    * lots of people in "Coders at Work" are duct tape


Issues

* focus on system design, not system purpose
* over extends design
* plans for contingencies that probably don't exist (yagni)
* all encompassing vague solutions are hard to start using
    * if you can't summarize your product in a couple sentences, something is wrong


Solutions

* couple generality with specificity
    * maybe a more general solution, with extensions for specific use cases
* paths forward to more general solutions
    * modularity
* if the general solution is easier, sure, do that
    * but make sure your high value single use is solid
